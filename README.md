# ai.art
 <i>ai.art</i> is a repository for creating AI art and artist experiments. To do so, we utilize knowledge from computational geometry, complexity science, information theory probabilistic machine learning, and various other computational domains. Here, we use this repository to trace our foundations and document our future.
