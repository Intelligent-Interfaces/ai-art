# ai.art
 <i>ai.art</i> is a repository for creating AI art and artist experiments. To do so, we utilize knowledge from <i>computational geometry</i>, <i>complexity science</i>, <i>information theory<i>, <i>probabilistic machine learning</i>, and various other computational domains. Here, we use this repository to trace our foundations and document our future.

### Current Projects
