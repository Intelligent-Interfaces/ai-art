### Function Sketches
```{R}

space-grammar <- c(size, cleanliness, geography, ...)

# A function splitting studio
studiosplitter <- function(pref, space-grammar){
  .
  .
  .
  return{reconfigure.space(space-grammar)}
}

# A function for reconfiguring space
reconfigure.space <- function(space-grammar){
  .
  .
  .
  return{reshaped.space}
}
```

## Organization
Currently trying to get a sense of the groups collective workflow. To help with this, we will be starting a couple of projects to see how everyone fits into the project.

## Meeting Summary
This was the initial meeting with all the members of the group. Everyone seems very aesthetically aligned. We also have a nice mix of skills: mathematics, physics, architecture, computer science, engineering, art, science, and technology. We spent a lot of time talking about metaballs and how we can apply this idea to automatic studio generation and space metamorphosis. There is apparently a deadline for some competition on April 20th. The deliverable for this competition would be a article.

## Inspiration
Notes to revisit for inspiration:
* Links on various architectural design studios
* Jeff Manoff?
* What is studio and how does it change in isolation and quarantine?
* [proving ground-1](https://provingground.io/2017/08/01/machine-learning-with-lunchboxml/)
* [proving ground-2](https://provingground.io/2017/06/29/analytics-machines-and-our-summer-so-far/)
* [geodesign](https://www.google.com/search?q=geodesign&safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS888US888&sxsrf=ALeKk03HLBwYghYmjpfY4BA8RtZIWnGhuA:1586453213441&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBpvXh7tvoAhVHd6wKHSMdBzwQ_AUoAnoECBQQBA&biw=1440&bih=714#imgrc=NPl3RekoCXii7M&imgdii=Iyj_USz4b2ee5M)

## TODO:
* Download Rhino
* Download Grasshopper
* Download LunchBoxML
* Look into metaball visualizations in javascript
* Look into metamorphosis for space
* Look into list of competitions the group may be interested in
