# QGA{}

The Quantum Generative Adversarial {RNN, CNN, Transformer, SNN} project (QGA{} pronounced "cue-gah") aims to use quantum computing and machine learning to make hybrid computing systems that have some advantage over their non-hybrid counterparts in the generation of artistic artifacts (e.g., drawings, photos, music, poetry) that can be demonstrated through real-time interaction.

## Idea 1: QGASNN
Idea 1: QGASNN aims to understand the construction and limitations of a generative model that consist of a generative adversarial network (GAN) with quantum enhancements. In particular, this hybrid computing system uses spiking neural networks (SNN) and quantum circuits (QC) for the generation of fake data and the discrimination of real data. The motivation behind such an architecture is both philosophical and technical. From the technical point of view, SNN are biologically-inspired universal function approximation systems that perform inference faster and with less energy than their perceptron predecessors. Additionally, QC makes uses of phenomena (i.e., superposition, interferences, and entanglement) to perform specific types of computations more efficiently than classical computers. From a philosophical perspective, quantum mechanics ought to provide an some explanation of spooky GAN creations (e.g., superposition of states) or represent a more realistic approach to decision making in the context of the arts.

In theory, combining both systems should yield an architecture that makes use of both systems respective advantages or mitigates their respective disadvantages (e.g., SNNs are difficult to train and QC are noisy). In practice, recent research has shown that combining SNN and QC offer improvements in learning/training and decision making/inference over SNN and CNN-QC architectures in image classification tasks. However, there is very little research on using SNN for generative tasks and virtually no research on quantum enhancements for SNN-based GANs.
