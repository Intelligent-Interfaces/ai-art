# Idea 1: QGASNN

Alright, so I know I'm going to be using python to source, connect, train, test, and integrate various computational processes. 

```python
# So in theory, any network or transformer can benefit from quantum enhancements

# Get data

# Machine Learning

# GAN process

# Quantum Computing

# Call QGAN with SNN
bare_model = QGAN(SNN)

# Train QGAN

# Test QGAN

# Demo using Streamlit

```
