\noindent This design project aims to integrate ideas from cultural evolution, machine learning, and generative design to construct a conceptual foundation of language evolution. Through the use of genetically-inspired optimized automatic speech recognition-hidden Markov models (GMM-ASR-HMM) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), people independently input personal aesthetic preferences to generate geometric visualizations. The design system runs on a mobile Linux-based computing system, where individuals choose the characteristics of the symbol displayed (i.e., color, complexity, shape, and amount) through a graphical user interface. In doing so, participants collaborate with and contribute to an ever-evolving design by providing individual input into the system's growing collection of preferences. The aggregated preferences reflective of the communities' aesthetic value are captured as a latent variable in the mathematical model. This design system can be generalized to track and model other forms of language evolution.
