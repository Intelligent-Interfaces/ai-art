Drawing Machine for:

Apply to art
Apply to movement
convolution neural network for facilities

CVN -> Optogenetics ->
light based movement


machine learning inference
Systems that can learn on the go

Softrobotics

Main issues:
how is a robot going to do a fluid manner

Main bottlenecks of Robotic 
in a light weight fashion
 
Systems that can

Neural Style Transfer with tf.keras:

What is tensorflow?
What is keras?

Figure out Neural Style
Figure out Processing
Combine style with processing

Claude Monet,
Picasso
What do you actually about this stlye?

How do people make filters

# Prominent art styles:

# 

Overleaf -> Atom -> Jupyter -> Collab -> Update ai.art github

Take network model of images and inspect 

GAN 
Two networks that

USE GAN as stlye transfer 

feed in a new images to discremeter

generator takes input

gen: draw hamza in the stlye of Picasso

dsic: is this an actual picasso painting or is this some bullshit

How do you balance between it looking like hamza and not

Extract style from style reference


fooling the generative in a non productive way....picking up on pattern it's not really supposed to 

Trying to produce an image of a new cat:

while:
solution space
Gen(random noise (vectors), loss value)
output(gen())

is.element.ofDisc()


Two networks:
Gen(hamza)
input:
output(Hamza)

while(valid):
  disc(output(hamza))

apply generator to discrimator

gen(hamza)

output: random hamza images
gen(output):
l_style
Bunch of images of Picasso

discrimator for the stlye and discremator for the content

content
image of hamza -> gen -> modified -> disc1_stlye -> stlye_loss -> does this look like 

What do you care about?
Content or style?

Computational Complexity:

Efficient Code:

Siamese twins siamese network

two objectivesL
tell more ralisticimages
maintain correlation with the orignal one

when does the discrimeter order matter.
