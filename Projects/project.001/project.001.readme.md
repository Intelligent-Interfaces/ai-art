### Meeting Notes:
#### 10/1/2019
<b>Overview:</b> Went through the seedbank neural style transfer (NST) tutorial. Talked about [Oxford's Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) neural network for image classification. Looked at [spongenuity](https://spongenuity.com/product-category/famous-faces/) for inspiration. Talked about various improvements and experiments related to generative adversarial networks using NST optimization for artistically styled images.
